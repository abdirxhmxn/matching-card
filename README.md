## 💻 Code Overview

### Player Constructor
```javascript
function Player(name) {
    this.name = name;
}
```

### Game Class
The `Game` class handles all core functionality:

```javascript
class Game {
    // Properties
    cells = document.querySelectorAll('.card')
    currentPlayer = player1
    gameOver = false
    arrayLetters = ['ا', 'ا', 'ب', 'ب', ...] // Arabic letters
    
    // Methods
    startGame()      // Initialize game and event listeners
    updateCell(i)    // Handle card clicks
    checkwinner()    // Determine game winner
    switchPlayer()   // Alternate turns in multiplayer
    deleteMatch()    // Remove matched cards
    randomBoard()    // Shuffle cards
    rematchGame()    // Reset for new round
}
```

### Key Features Implemented

**Card Matching Logic**
```javascript
if (this.cardFlipped.length === 2) {
    if (this.cardFlipped[0].innerText === this.cardFlipped[1].innerText) {
        // Match found - update score
        this.currentPlayerScore += 2;
        this.deleteMatch();
    } else {
        // No match - flip back after delay
        setTimeout(() => this.update(), 1000);
    }
}
```

**URL Parameter Navigation**
```javascript
// Passing data between pages
const url = new URL(window.location.href);
player1 = new Player(url.searchParams.get("p1"));
player2 = new Player(url.searchParams.get("p2"));
```

**Winner Determination**
- Handles single winner scenarios
- Detects 2-way and 3-way ties
- Displays appropriate victory message

## 📱 Responsive Design

The game includes breakpoint optimizations for:

- **Desktop** (1200px+)
- **Laptop** (992px - 1199px)
- **Tablet** (768px - 991px)
